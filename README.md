# dotstar
dotstar is a Python 3 program to automate the installation and configuration of everything I think useful and cool on a Linux distro.



## DISCLAIMER:
dotstar is currently under development, so **it is UNUSABLE**. Come back later! If you really appreciate my initiative, you can star it to find it easily later.

## Main features
- Get a full setup Linux from a fresh installation in minutes!* From applications install, configuration & plugin setup to the look of your DE (Desktop Environment), your Linux will be freaking awesome.

- **You** have the power: dotstar will always ask for your permission on each of its actions (from installing an app to changing a color scheme).

- Useful no matter your experience:

    - You're a complete noob with Linux? dotstar will help you to get everything you will need for your first steps in this awesome world.

    - You're an advanced user, but you're annoyed to reinstall everything manually each time you change your distro? Fork dotstar to get a base for your own fast installation and configuration app!

    - You're just a classic user looking for awesome apps and a fast rocking of the look of your DE? You're in the right place too.

- dotstar uses categories, so for exemple it will ask you if you want some text editors, then for each text editor if you want to install it. 

*The speed will of course depend on of your connexion if you choose to install heavy apps.



## Controls
After starting the app, dotstar will successively ask you if you want it to effectuate the proposed action.

- Accept an action with `y` (for *yes*), decline with `n` (for *no*).
  
- You don't understand what the tool is asking? Answer `-h` (for *help*) to get some help (unavailable for now).

- You miss clic your last answer? Don't panic: answer `-p` (for *previous*) to reverse the last action and then return to it (unavailable for now).
